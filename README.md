# Image Processing and Analysis Suite
The "Image Processing and Analysis Suite" is a versatile project that implements various image processing techniques to explore and manipulate digital images. This suite includes functions for calculating image compression rates, adjusting brightness, modifying specific color areas, simulating JPEG compression, and fully downsampling image components, all using the YCbCr color space for precise control.

Key Features:
1. Compression Rate Calculation:
- Computes the compression rate by comparing the uncompressed image size to the actual file size.
- Provides insights into the efficiency of image compression.
2. Brightness Adjustment:
- Enhances image brightness by manipulating the Y component in the YCbCr color space.
- Increases visibility without distorting color balance.
3. Red Area Modification:
- Identifies and alters red areas by adjusting the Cr component in the YCbCr color space.
- Reduces the prominence of red tones for targeted color adjustments.
4. JPEG Compression Simulation:
- Mimics JPEG compression by downsampling and upsampling the Cb and Cr components.
- Demonstrates the impact of lossy compression on image quality.
5. Full Component Downsampling:
- Downscales and then upscales all YCbCr components.
- Illustrates the effects of comprehensive downsampling on image quality.
